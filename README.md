# Catan Tracker

A fun little project that helps my wife and I keep track of our Catan record. 

Built with:
* AWS
* Twilio
* Google Sheets


We text a phone number our results and then we get a response of our current record for the overall game, the specific game type we played, and the conditions of the environment we were in.
